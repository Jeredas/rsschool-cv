Hi! My name is Vladimir Komarov I’m 27 years old and I’m beginner frontend-developer.  
---  

I am from Belarus and live in Vitebsk. Probably better way to start self-introduction from education.  

In 2009, I have finished school and entered Vitebsk State Technical College. My study lasted for 4 years and ended in 2013.  
I got diploma of builder –technician and entered Polotsk State University for short track in absentia.
Unfortunately, later that year I was drafted to army and continued study only 2 years later.
In 2020, I have finished Polotsk State University becoming engineer and getting bachelor's degree in industrial and civil building.  
More than 4 years I have been working as foreman in a building company. But for some reasons I wish to switch my profession and got a lot of motivation to do that.  

  My way in programming started right after I have finished university and got a lot of free time. Therefore, I remember my old dream – to try myself in learning  
any programming language. I have made a research how to make it more productively and less pain, so my choice fell on Python. From that time, I have been spending all my free   
time solving task on different online courses and getting knowledge in algorithms data structures. However, through all this this time I cannot decide which direction should  
I go (frontend, backend, mobile, dev. ops or may be something else). Also I took in attention job market and demand for the language in my region.  

  One day my friend recommended me to try RSS and their frontend JavaScript course. The requirements were pretty tough but I decided to take this challenge.  
First of all, because JavaScript is demanded language now and frontend in common is more obvious for beginner.  

  So this is my story about how I got in your screen.  
	Some words about my motivation and myself.  
	
First of all I have advantage before the youth and students especially – this advantage is a real life experience. I have some from my current and past jobs.   
I  clearly see what I expect from my profession and life. Unfortunately building sphere in my country is situating in «stone age» (I can talk all day about it but   
I’ll better keep your time).Now I realize - I want to work in the twenty first century and IT is one of the few professional spheres that is in it.   
When I was a student I cannot see it and almost nobody can I think.  

  Besides I have a lot of strong soft skills such as sociability , self-criticism, punctuality , responsibility, hard-working, self-and time-management ,  
and from my supervisor experience system thinking, development and decision making , team work, motivation and leadership.  

  What about my hard skills?  
	
  For all those time I’ve been learning programming I’ve replenished my knowledge with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ECMAScript 6),Basic Python and Git also   
I’ve got acquainted with React, Redux, NodeJS  and Django.  

  My portfolio is not big yet . I’ve made few basic minigames (15, gallows, snake, magic ball etc) weather bot for telegram, and some little apps such as virtual   
piano and photo philter. Soon it will be replenished with online zoo. 

  Thanks for watching, here is my contacts , please leave your feedback, bye.
